          Hey there! I’m William, a 24-year-old Software Engineering student at the University of
          Turku in Finland. I’m currently in my fourth year, majoring in Software Development with a
          minor in Cybersecurity. I’ve always been fascinated by how technology shapes our world,
          and I’m excited to be a part of it.
